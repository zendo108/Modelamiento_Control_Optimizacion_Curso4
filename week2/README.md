# Week 2: Non-Isothermal Reactor Modeling - Lecture Notes

This folder contains the lecture notes, equations, and concepts covered in the **Week 2 Monday Lecture** of the Modeling, Control, and Process Engineering course.
$$ \\mathcal{L}(x,y,\\lambda) =  xy^2 + \\lambda (x^2+y^2 -1)$$"
## Overview
This lecture focuses on developing and understanding mathematical models for non-isothermal chemical reactors. It introduces balance equations for mass and energy and derives a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to represent reactor behavior. The topics are applicable to both industrial and academic settings in process modeling and control.

## Key Topics Covered
- **Mass Balance Equations**
  - General mass balance for a control volume.
  - Mass balance for specific components (e.g., reactants).
  - Concentration dynamics and reaction rates.

- **Energy Balance Equations**
  - General energy balance for a control volume.
  - Heat transfer mechanisms (conduction, convection, and radiation).
  - Reaction heat effects and temperature dynamics.

- **Non-Isothermal Reactor Equations**
  - Combined ODE system for temperature (\(dT/dt\)) and concentration (\(dC_A/dt\)).
  - Modeling assumptions:
    - Constant volume.
    - Single inflow and outflow stream.
    - Arrhenius reaction kinetics.
    - Heat capacity and density remain constant.

## System of ODEs
The derived equations describe:
1. **Temperature Dynamics**:

   \[
   \frac{dT}{dt} = \frac{AU}{\rho V \bar{c}_P} \Delta T + \frac{F_i}{V} \bar{c}_P (T_i - T) - \frac{r \Delta h_R}{\rho \bar{c}_P}
   \]
3. **Concentration Dynamics**:

   \[
   \frac{dC_A}{dt} = \frac{F_i}{V} (C_{Ai} - C_A) - k_A e^{-\frac{E}{RT}} C_A^n
   \]

These equations form the foundation for reactor design, control, and optimization tasks.

## How to Use
1. Review the equations and concepts provided in the lecture notes.
2. Refer to the [example slides](path-to-uploaded-slides-if-applicable) for detailed derivations and illustrations.
3. Use the provided equations to simulate reactor behavior or design process controllers.

## Next Steps
- Implement numerical methods to solve the ODE system (e.g., Runge-Kutta, Euler).
- Extend the model to account for additional factors such as variable volume or multiple reactions.
